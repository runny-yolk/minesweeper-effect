# minesweeper-effect
Minesweeper Effect is a modern take on the classic Minesweeper, in the style of Tetris Effect.

Made in under 24 hours, in Unity 2020.1.14f1, using Universial Render Pipeline and Shader Graph.

All scripts are in C#. All sound effects made in Ableton and sfxr (the latter of which is made for game devs, is free, and very good).
